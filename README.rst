What is py-esp32-ulp?
---------------------

It is an assembler toolchain for the ESP32 ULP (Ultra Low-Power) Co-Processor,
written in MicroPython.

The goal is to be able to translate small assembler language programs to
a loadable/executable machine code binary, at runtime, on the ESP32
microcontroller, from projects implemented in MicroPython.

This is intended as an alternative approach to assembling such programs on a
development machine using the binutils-esp32ulp toolchain from Espressif.
